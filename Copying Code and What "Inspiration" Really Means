When you want to use the code from another mod, never outright copy the code.
In practice, always learn how the code works and adapt it into what you want to do. Copying the code is just dishonest and likely against licenses.

Inspiration in mods is NOT copying the code from another mod and tweaking little things.
Inspiration is using general concepts from another mod in a loose way, sort of like doing something similar.

If I wanted to make a mod that was inspired by, say Charter, I would not fully copy Charter's ideas and gimmicks.
Instead, I would use the concept of the mod (generally a uniting theme of the mod when it's stripped bear, Charter's being occult artifacts, lore, and permadeath.)
Occult artifacts, in this example, and make my own ideas around it.

Never steal the idea of another mod.

If your mod idea is similar to another mod that's fine, it's extremely difficult to be entirely original.

Same with assets.

And also, never try to recreate an existing mod simply because you can't use it. It always ends in a worse product and failure.
If you focus on trying to make something that already exists it won't have a more satisfying end output when you use it. It'll be incomplete.

I know this is very loose but try following the spirit of this. Don't copy code or mod ideas, and don't recreate stuff.
