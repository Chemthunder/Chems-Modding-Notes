ServerWorld and World are different actions that apply on the user's world.

ServerWorld is actions that are commands and details to the physical world, such as time, weather, and more complex particles

World is less advanced and just client-side things that apply to everyone
(Correct me if I'm wrong, this is all my opinion and understanding of everything.)
