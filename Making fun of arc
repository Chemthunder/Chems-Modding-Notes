Fun stuff to poke fun at ArcCM (Or Katto or whatever the fuck)


Item registry classes DO NOT have to be called ModNameItems. You can name literally any of your classes whatever the hell you want, conflicting classes literally
only happens if you are using the same src package names:

example:
src/main/org/examplemod/registries/ExampleModItems

src/main/org/examplemod/registries/ExampleModItems

Be aware this will likely never happen, because everyone uses a different name for their packages. Saying you SHOULD do this is stupid
because you will likely never need to. It's always safe to take precautions but this is a wee excessive.

Yes you can name your item registries anything across any version, it does not fucking matter.

Also, don't use Text.literal for tooltips, nor make having enters harder than they should be. Yes this is good if you want different colors but it really
doesn't matter when some libraries do this for you.

Use \n, it's much better.

Also Arc, I saw what you put in ArcSenal_1.19.2, fix your sorry excuse for pulling entities toward you.
Use entity.getRotationVec, it saves so much time, and it works across versions.

Remove the stolen assets from Eternite as well while you're at it, art thief.
